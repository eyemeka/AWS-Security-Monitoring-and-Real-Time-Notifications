# AWS Security Monitoring and Real Time Notifications

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project focuses on setting up comprehensive identity monitoring and alerting within an AWS environment. It involves configuring three primary AWS services: <strong>CloudTrail</strong>, <strong>SNS (Simple Notification Service)</strong>, and <strong>EventBridge</strong>, to create an efficient alert system around AWS identity calls, specifically the <strong>GetCallerIdentity</strong> API call.

<strong>CloudTrail</strong> is configured to log and monitor all AWS account activity, ensuring a complete record of actions, especially identity-related events. <strong>SNS</strong> is then set up to send real-time email notifications for critical events, enabling immediate visibility when specific API calls, such as GetCallerIdentity, are made. Finally, <strong>EventBridge</strong> is configured to trigger whenever the GetCallerIdentity API call is executed, activating an alert pipeline that sends notifications via SNS.

This setup enhances security by providing timely alerts on identity-related activities, helping administrators maintain a robust audit trail, and quickly respond to potential unauthorized access attempts or misconfigurations.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project enhances security and monitoring within AWS by configuring CloudTrail, SNS, and EventBridge to track identity-based actions. By logging all account activity through CloudTrail and setting up SNS for email notifications, we create a real-time alert system for identity-related events. Specifically, EventBridge is configured to trigger notifications whenever the <strong>GetCallerIdentity</strong> API call is made, allowing immediate awareness of any identity verification attempts within the AWS environment. This setup strengthens security posture by enabling swift responses to potentially unauthorized access attempts or unusual account activity.

<h2 class="styled__Paragraph-sc-y5pp90-3 eHgPWw">3. Set Up EventBridge to Trigger on GetCallerIdentity for Root User</h2>
<h3 class="styled__Paragraph-sc-y5pp90-3 eHgPWw">Navigate to EventBridge:</h3>
<h4>Create a Rule:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Click on "Rules".</li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The successful setup and testing of AWS Security Monitoring and Real-Time Notifications with CloudTrail, SNS, and EventBridge to monitor <em>GetCallerIdentity</em> API calls, enhances security monitoring and operational visibility within the AWS environment. By configuring CloudTrail to log API activity, SNS for real-time alerts, and EventBridge to trigger specific responses, I have created a comprehensive monitoring solution that is proactive and responsive to potential unauthorized access attempts or anomalies in account activity. This solution not only strengthens an organization's ability to detect and respond to security events but also lays a solid foundation for more advanced monitoring and automation as part of a robust AWS security posture.
